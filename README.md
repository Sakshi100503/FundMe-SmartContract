# FundMe Smart Contract | Solidity 
A decentralized fundraising application built using Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract is developed and deployed through the Remix IDE. This project enables transparent and secure crowdfunding while leveraging blockchain technology.

## Features -

- Funding System : Users can send ETH to the contract.
- Payable Functionality : Allows the contract to receive Ether.
- Secure fundraising using Ethereum smart contracts.
- Transparent and immutable transactions.
- Ability to set funding goals and deadlines.
- Refunds for contributors if the funding goal is not met.
- Owner-only withdrawal of funds once the goal is reached.

## Technologies Used - 

- Solidity: Smart contract language.
- Remix IDE: Development and deployment platform.
- MetaMask: Ethereum wallet for transactions.

## Prerequisites -

1.	Install the MetaMask browser extension and connect it to a test network (e.g., Goerli or Sepolia).
2.	Get test Ether from a faucet for transactions.
   
## Steps -

1.	Open the Remix IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/.
2.	Create a new file and paste the FundMe.sol code.
3.	Compile the smart contract:
      - Go to the Solidity Compiler tab.
      -	Select the appropriate compiler version.
      -	Click Compile FundMe.sol.
4.	Deploy the contract:
      -	Navigate to the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.
      -	Select the environment (e.g., Injected Provider for MetaMask).
      -	Deploy the contract and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
5.	Interact with the contract:
      -	Use the deployed contract's interface in Remix to start campaigns, contribute, and withdraw funds.

## Testing
1. Use Remixâ€™s built-in testing tools to verify the contract.
2. Deploy the contract on a test network like Goerli or Sepolia and simulate real transactions.
