ðŸ”¥ **Step 1**: Create a contract called `FUNDME`.

- Declare the **owner** of the contract (the one who deploys it).  
- Add a **minimum contribution** constant of ether.  

ðŸ”¥ **Step 3**:  
- Create a function called `fund()` to allow users to send ETH.  
- Track:  
  - Contributors' addresses.  
  - The amount of ETH each contributed.  

ðŸ”¥ **Step 4**:  
- Add a `withdraw()` function that:  
  - Can only be called by the **owner**.  
  - Resets contributors' balances.  

ðŸ”¥ **Step 5**:  
- Add a **modifier** called `OnlyOwner` to restrict access to owner-only functions.  

ðŸ”¥ **Step 6**:  
- Implement **receive()** and **fallback()** functions to handle direct ETH transfers.  

ðŸ”¥ **Step 7**:  
- Deploy the contract ðŸš€.
